    <string name = "intentionPrompt_one">You are an in-car interaction intent recognition expert. Please complete the analysis and selection for the following multiple-choice question.\n\n【Task Description】\nAnalyze the dialogue content between the "In-Car Assistant" and the "User" below. Based on the 【Option Definitions】 and 【Analysis Steps】, select the most appropriate option (A/B/C/D) that aligns with the user's intent.\n\n【Dialogue Content】\nAssistant:{%s}\nUser:{%s}\n\n【Option Definitions】\nA. Performance Adjustment Request: The user directly or indirectly expresses a desire to change specific vehicle performance parameters (e.g., adjusting power, suspension, chassis, steering feel or stiffness, etc.).\nB. Positive/Affirmative Response: The user explicitly agrees with or accepts the assistant's suggestion regarding the vehicle state, or expresses satisfaction/liking toward the current mode.\nC. Negative/Negation/Rejection: The user refuses the assistant's suggestion, expresses no need, disagrees, or shows dissatisfaction/dislike toward the current vehicle state/suggestion.\nD. Irrelevant/Mismatch: The user's response does not directly address the assistant's question or topic. This includes off-topic answers, initiating a new unrelated inquiry (e.g., asking about navigation, destination, weather, music) instead of responding to the mode switch suggestion.\n\n【Analysis Steps】\n1. **Topic Consistency &amp; Q-A Alignment Check**:\n- **If Assistant has input (Assistant:{...})**: Check if the User's response effectively answers the specific question asked by the Assistant.\n- **Critial Check**: If the Assistant asks about "mode switching/performance" and the User ignores this constraint to ask about **Navigation/Destination/Location** (e.g., "Where are we?", "Navigate to X") or creates a "Non-Sequitur" (irrelevant follow-up), **Select D**.\n- Only proceed if the User's response is relevant to the "performance/mode" decision.\n- **If Assistant has NO input (Assistant:{})**: Analyze if the User is discussing "vehicle performance" or "driving experience" (suspension, power, comfort).\n- If the statement is **related** to Navigation/Media/Chat (e.g., "Play music," "Navigate home"), **Select D**.\n- If the statement is **related** to vehicle controls, proceed to Step 2.\n\n2. **Distinguish Between "Adjustment Request" and "Response Attitude"**:\n- Check whether the user explicitly mentions **specific parameter modification requests** (make it stiffer/softer, increase power). If yes, **select A**.\n- Note: Phrases like "no need to adjust" indicate rejection (C), not A.\n\n3. **Sentiment Polarity Judgment (For relevant responses only)**:\n- **Positive Category (Select B)**: The user expresses agreement ("Okay/Sure/Yes"), confirmation, or satisfaction with the specific suggestion made by the assistant.\n- **Negative Category (Select C)**: The user expresses refusal ("No need"), negation, or dissatisfaction.\n\n4. **Fallback Judgment**:\n- If the user's intent implies ignoring the current topic to start a new one, or if none of the above applies, select D.\n\nNow, based on the above logic, output the most appropriate option letter :</string>
    <string name="promptTemplate_feedback">Convergence: Refers to the speed and feel of the process by which a vehicle's chassis and body systems return to equilibrium after experiencing transient excitation (such as driving over potholes, fast lane change recovery), affecting driving steadiness and comfort.\n\n- Absolute Value CA: Range 0～4, five levels, defines the baseline convergence characteristic. The 0 end is ultimate softness and long travel; the 4 end is ultimate swiftness and shortness.\n- Relative Value CR: Range -2～+2, five levels, used to fine-tune convergence dynamics. Positive values make recovery faster, negative values make it slower; |CR|=1 indicates a mild adjustment, |CR|=2 indicates a decisive adjustment.\n\n【Based on Rules】:\nPlease execute parameter configuration according to the following rules:\n1.Interlock Mechanism: The absolute and relative value parameters for Responsiveness and Convergence are in an interlocked state. When enabling an absolute value for a characteristic, its relative value must be cleared; when enabling a relative value, its absolute value must be cleared. The two cannot coexist.\n2.Silence Means Default Rule: If the user instruction remains silent on Responsiveness or Convergence (providing no relevant description), interpret it as \"maintain the status quo.\" The system should set the absolute value for that characteristic to empty and the relative value to 0.\n3.Output Integrity Contract: The generated response object must be a complete structure with a fixed key order: first RA, then RR, then CA, and finally CR. All keys must exist.\n\n【Output Specifications】:\nOutput specification: Please construct the following dictionary object and fill in all fields: {'response': {'RA': ..., 'RR': ..., 'CA': ..., 'CR': ...}, 'reasoning': '...'}. The parameter values in response need to be explicitly set, and reasoning must provide sufficient explanation.\n\n【input】:%s</string>
